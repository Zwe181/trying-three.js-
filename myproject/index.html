      <p>I tried to use three.js</p>

      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I wanted to explore something fun, interactive, and visually rich â€” and Three.js was the
        perfect match.
      </p>

      <p>
        Itâ€™s a powerful JavaScript library that enables the creation of 3D graphics directly in the browser using WebGL,
        without needing heavy tools or engines.</p>

      <p>
        One of the main reasons I chose Three.js is how it makes working with 3D much more accessible. Instead of
        dealing with complex WebGL code,
        Three.js provides a simple way to render 3D objects, animations, and scenes right in the browser. This means I
        can focus on designing
        creative experiences without needing deep knowledge of graphics programming. Whether itâ€™s spinning shapes or
        realistic environments, Three.js
        makes it possible to bring 3D to everyday web projects. </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Benefitss</h2>

      <p>
        The biggest strength of Three.js is its flexibility and community. From simple rotating cubes to full-blown 3D
        worlds, it scales easily.
        It supports textures, lighting, shadows, physics integrations, and more. The plugin also plays nicely with other
        libraries like GSAP or
        dat.GUI, giving you full control over your scene. </p>

      <h2>Beyond the Proof-of-Concept</h2>

      <p>
        This project is just a starting point. In real-world applications, Three.js can be used in product
        configurators, architectural previews,
        data visualizations, or interactive art installations. Learning it here gives me a foundation for future
        creative or professional projects
        that go beyond 2D. </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <h3>What I want to do with this next?</h3>
      <p>
        I am thinking of making a portfolio website with Three.js. I want to showcase my projects in a 3D environment, allowing users to interact with
        the projects in a more immersive way. I also want to explore the use of shaders and post-processing effects to enhance the visual quality of the
        website. Additionally, I want to experiment with different 3D models and animations to create a unique and engaging user experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Another Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        If I have time, I want to make one more website for a interior design student, where they can host a 3D model of their design projects. The website will allow users to
        interact with the 3D model, view it from different angles, and even change the colors and materials of the objects in the scene.
         This will give the student a unique way to showcase their work and allow potential clients to see their designs in a more interactive way.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Plugins</h3>
      <p>
        I want to explore more plugins other than three.js. I want to make some web games as well, though that will be extreme. I want to learn more about js before actually building the website.
        That way, I hope I will find less obstacles.
